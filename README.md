# Pre-Work Study Guide

## Description

The point of this study guide is to help increase knowledge about coding and to use as a reference for any coding lesson.
The motivation behind this is to help in the future whoever needs something back to look on for some extra help and to not forget what commands to run when using certain programs.
The problems I managed to solve with this were figuring out how to run a terminal with "cd" commands or using "git" to access some parts of my project branch. This provided me with the
necessary resources to figure out how to code the bare minimum of a website and debug the problems I faced in my website.
To end off, what I've learned from this experience is how to build a fully functional website and how to use different coding programs and what they require in order to work.
I hope this helps anybody who is just scratching the surface and what to know the basic fundamentals of coding!
